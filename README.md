Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your project manager.

## Description

The client for this challenge is _Spacewalkers Magazine_. Spacewalkers needs your help to build a small proof of concept website for their marketing team. They have provided designs for both desktop and phone views. In addition to designs and content they have most of the home page coded for you. You just need to finish the navigation and header as well as the mobile styles.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution design files of the desktop and mobile views:

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive web site changes the styling at specified break points. A fully responsive web site looks
good on any device's screen, even devices that are sized between the specified break points.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first design is built using the mobile view as the foundation. Then breakpoints are added to make the site
look good on bigger screens. Desktop first is the opposite. It's built starting with the desktop. Then breakpoints are
added to make the site look good on smaller screens.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

With font-size: 62.5%, a rem on a standard 100% view screen, is 10px. However because rems are relative length units,
the user can adjust their screen, and the elements will size up or down.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a way to change how you write CSS so you have access to more tools.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept is nesting. I really like how easy it is to write css with it because it's easy to see where everything
is.

The one that gave me a little more trouble were parametric mixins because I didn't understand where they were useful.
I think they weren't that useful to me on these student projects but could be useful on a bigger project.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.

## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:


## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

### Import LESS Files

* [x] Navigate to your `index.less` file. Notice the file is blank. You have been asked to use a certain import order. That order is as follows:

```markdown
1.variables.less
2.mixins.less
3.reset.less
4.global.less
5.navigation.less
6.footer.less
7.home-page.less
```

_You will know everything is working properly when you see the styles enabled for the provided content._  

### Home Page - Desktop HTML & LESS

* [x] Take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built.

* [x] Add a viewport meta tag to the head of your index.html page

* [x] [Review the provided home desktop design file](design-files/home-desktop.png). You are to build the missing navigation system and header image. You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html)

* [x] Navigation Styles: Use the `navigation.less` file for styling.

* [x] Main Content Styles: Use the `home-page.less` file for styling

* [x] LESS Mixins: Create and use 2 different mixins to aid your styling. Use the `mixins.less` file for your mixins

* [x] LESS Parametric Mixin: create a parametric mixin that is used to create the `sign up` button styles.

* [x]  Use at least 2 parameters to create your button

* [x] Create a hover state that swaps the background color and font color of the base button styles.

### Mobile Design

* [x] Create a `@phone` variable that contains a `max-width: 500px` media query string. Use the `@phone` variable for all your nested mobile styling.

* [x] [Review the provided home mobile design file](design-files/home-mobile.png). Match your mobile styling the best you can using the design file.

* [x] Push your changes and create a pull request if you haven't already.

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items. Come up with content and images that fit the theme.

* [ ] Introduce CSS animations to your site.

* [ ] Create a fixed navigation and add some opacity to the background

* [ ] Create a form that would allow someone to sign up for a Spacewalkers Magazine subscription
